It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.

It wasn't crowded so the service was fine but I could see on a busy Friday or Saturday the service would be less than stellar. We drank a beer (they only have bottled beers) and sat by the river to watch the boats go by.  The beers are pricy as our Curious Traveler Shandy was $6.50 each but it was a perfect drink for a hot day!  The menu is mostly seafood and pricey-the buffalo shrip where you only get 5 was $11.

You made a decision to break their rules and therefore have lost your deposit.\\\\  WOW.  All I can say is if this is such a dire safety issue\"\n 'Such a nice & fun zoo. The kids lived it!!!'\n \"Just a tip...if you're going with kids in the heat\"\n 'Though the name of the store has changed over the years'\n \"The other reviews are right on. This place is so weird and sketchy I would never send my wife here. The inside looks like a great place to get murdered. I prefer to sit outside thinking about which direction I'd run if shit goes down. But the people are nice and they do a thorough job on the car for a good price. BUT ONLY IF YOU HAVE CASH!\"\n 'Well this has been one of my favorite courses since I moved here in 1988. I have played this course many'\n 'The smell'\n \"Phoenix has a large but scattered population. I'm not sure why developers picked this location for a Chinese Culture Center.  It doesn't make sense to me as the area around Dobson might seem more appropriate.\\\\n\\\\nThe center seems like it'd have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay.  I've heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal.  It's now not much more than a nearly-empty strip mall with \\\\Asian\\\\ architecture.  I live up the street and would rather drive to Mesa/Chandler for anything Asian. Sad because I hoped Phoenix could do better.\"\n 'If you have a Mercedes'\n 'I have lived here my whole life.  And for most of that time I have pretty much eaten gringocized Mexican food.  You know'\n 'Tried this place on a lazy Sunday evening at the recommendation of other reviews'\n \"Came here looking for soup dumplings after having an amazing experience in NYC's Chinatown. I know it's really not fair to compare this place with what we had in NYC\"\n \"Maybe I'm doing it wrong. Maybe I'm just taking crazy pills (you can buy a bottle of 10\"\n 'Came here for a drug screen for a new job. Tried to call for 2 days to set up a time to come in. Time is money. Every time I tried to call the number listed the call would ring and then just disconnect. So due to the fact there is a time expiration on the drug screen. Came in to get it done. Show up'\n 'Wow..never thought there is a difference between dive bars and found out there is a big difference.  This place should be categorize as a shit bar instead of a dive bar! \\\\n\\\\nCalled about 1:30 and ask about employment there and was told by some bitch working there said \\\\no we are not hiring\\\\ and then with her stupid uneducated trailer trash bitch attitude ass added \\\\if you are in the business'\n \"What happened to all of the coverage on the local sports?  The Arcadia News used to be very supportive and involved in Arcadia High School athletics.  No articles and only some pictures of some of the sports these days.  Shouldn't a local paper support its local high school?\"\n \"I've been to this Applebee's about five or six times over the last 3 years.\\\\n\\\\nThe menu is\"\n 'Not only is the food overpriced and barely edible'\n \"I normally don't prefer to eat at chains (though I will on occasion)\"\n 'Do not eat here. Terrible.'\n 'Terrie really made our experience. I love Applebees anyway'\n \"This placement doesn't even deserve a star so I guess one will do. The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess\"\n \"Planned to have lunch & a drink (alcohol) w/my dad & bf.  The server carded me (I'm 30!!!) \"\n \"Just went to grab a quick lunch to go and must say this is the wrost prepared food to date. I've gone hear at least 30 times before and this is the first time that I can honestly say it sucked. They weren't really busy\"\n \"Walking into Macayo's is like entering a buffet restaurant in a Vegas casino. Tacky\"\n 'A very odd experience.  \\\\n\\\\nWe entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well'\n 'Happened upon this restaurant while staying at a nearby hotel. We drove by earlier in the day and were first interested in the unique architecture of the building. The decor inside was fun and had an old-school feel. Lots of pink and green'\n 'Macayos is like Chuck E. Cheese without the games. Lots of kids running around. Young servers navigating first jobs with little supervision and varied results. Often bland or lukewarm food that takes an eternity to order and arrive. \\\\n\\\\nAt least at Chuck E Cheese'\n 'Yesterday' 'No' \"It's my little sister's 17th birthday (yes\"\n \"I ordered flowers for two friends. When I spoke to the designer about the size he was more then helpful with exchanging some of the flowers to create a bigger bouquet. It's almost two weeks later and my friend said they still look beautiful just as when they arrived. Both friends said they were lovely. I will use them again.\"\n 'I just love going here!  You can find anything you need and a whole bunch of eccentric and cool gifts that you know no one else will have!  \\\\n\\\\nSo normally I go there to browse in their extensive wine selection and end up leaving with a few bottles of dessert wine.  Or I grab some sake'\n 'Oh'\n \"I was across the street for a Dr appointment and decided to step into the AJs after to browse since it was \\\\right there\\\\. Haven't been into one in years for the same reason that I probably won't return after the recent visit: way overpriced for things I can buy elsewhere. Almost everything in the store you can buy at any regular grocery store\"\n 'Love the food' 'When I lived a block from Pane Bianco'\n 'The Housemade Mozzarella'\n 'It takes me 25 minutes to drive there and it is well worth it. The food is phenomenal and considering its quality'\n 'Really good lunch spot for takeout (the restaurant is divided into takeout and dine-in'\n \"The fish and chips is where it's at. The coleslaw is pretty much the best i have ever had. The shepherds pie is excellent as well. The best pub food in Phoenix by far.\"\n 'DH & I went for dinner there tonight'\n 'G&D was our first stop for our Pub Crawl'\n \"I like to focus on the positive so let's start there. The hot wings. Get em spicy hot. They were really good. Worth going here for? No\\\\n\\\\nIt's a dark bar\"\n 'Last night was my first visit to George and Dragon....and unfortunately'\n \"I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in\"\n 'Oh King George'\n 'I love this location for Fed Ex. They were a life saver for me over the Christmas holidays. They are always cheerful and friendly when you come in. Even though when  they say hello many people do not respond. Rude people!!  Any way'\n 'Got a call from the General Manager John who was very nice and assured me they are not a homeless shelter. Perhaps I will go back and try them again.'\n \"Stopped into this shop during spring training.  The staff was nice but he really pushed the Kristoffs as he had the vendor in the shop.  We bought 3 of them based on the recommendation and we were going to get a box if we liked them.  The cigars didn't draw well and were generally not very good.  We went back into the shop to let them know and they offered absolutely nothing after we had spent $170 there the day before and only bought the Kristoffs on their recommendation (at 10 a stick).  We won't be going back.\"\n \"I don't know why others had such a problem with the owner Petey: I went in for the first time last weekend and he was just fine. Perhaps its because I've learned over the years how to communicate to boutique shop owners that I'm not \\\\just looking\\\\ but I'm on a hunt for the perfect fucking end tables and I hate chrome.\\\\n\\\\nYou would be surprised how far that approach goes at any place: tell the owner what you like and don't like right away. Letting them know you have an opinion allows them to engage with you as someone who appreciates design; not just another customer.\\\\n\\\\nNow with that rant out of the way\"\n \"If the stale retirement home setting and stuck-in-the-80's styled menu don't encourage you to leave before ordering\"\n 'Hubby insisted we had eaten here before. I thought not. I was partly right'\n 'The first time I experienced The Eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room.
